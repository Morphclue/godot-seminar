\section*{Abstract}
This paper examines the relevance of the Godot Engine in the indie game industry.
The Godot Engine is a relatively new game engine from 2014 and competes with leading market players.
To get to the bottom of its relevance, two major online sales platforms and the game engines that are commonly used, Steam and itch.io, are examined.
Mainly, these findings are compared with reference data from 2018.
It turns out that the Godot engine has gained massive relevance in 2020 and now seems to be one of the leading players in the indie game industry.
The exact causes are difficult to determine.
However, this paper provides many clues for further research in this area.
