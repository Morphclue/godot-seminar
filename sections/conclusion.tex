\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the methods of analysis used here have raised many new questions.
These should continue to be investigated.
The market relevance in general or specifically for indie game studios could be further analyzed.
Possible suggestions include interviews with indie game studios that use the Godot Engine.
Additionally, in the case of GameMaker, it would be interesting to do further research to see if the Godot Engine is slowly pushing them out of the market.
For this, interviews could also be useful or a feature matrix, which draws a direct technical comparison between both game engines.
As previously mentioned, a comparison between Unity, Unreal Engine and Godot Engine should also be sought.
It can currently be said that the Godot Engine has a high relevance in the indie game industry.
This is evidenced not only by various major companies that have provided financial support, but also by the analysis on Steam and itch.io. 
The digital sales platform for indie games itch.io in particular has clearly demonstrated this.
