\section{Analysis}
In the last section it became clear that the Godot engine could attract the interest of larger companies.
This already indicates a certain relevance in the video game industry.
However, this does not yet point to the actual question of how relevant the Godot Engine is for indie game developers.
First, we have to define what exactly is meant by indie game development.
Just as the definition of a game engine is elusive, so is the definition of indie game development and indie games developed.
The definition used here is from O'Donnell, which states that indie games focus on a few goals and can be developed on a smaller scale in terms of manpower\cite{indie-definition}.
This is in contrast to AAA titles, which are developed with high budgets and large teams.
