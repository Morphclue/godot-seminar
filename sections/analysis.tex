\section{Analysis}
In the last section it became clear that the Godot engine could attract the interest of larger companies.
This already indicates a certain relevance in the video game industry.
However, this does not yet point to the actual question of how relevant the Godot Engine is for indie game developers.
First, we have to define what exactly is meant by indie game development.
Just as the definition of a game engine is elusive, so is the definition of indie game development and indie games developed.
The definition used here is from O'Donnell, which states that indie games focus on a few goals and can be developed on a smaller scale in terms of manpower\cite{indie-definition}.
An indie game development team is not financially supported by a larger company.
This is in contrast to AAA titles, which are developed with high budgets and large teams.\\

For this paper, the digital sales platforms Steam and itch.io were selected for investigation.
On the one hand, this refers to a study that provides comparative data from 2018.
On the other hand, reference is made to a survey with 2700 video game developers.
The focus in this paper is on PC and not on console or mobile games.
This is because the survey ``State of the Game Industry'' from 2022 showed that 63\% are actively developing for PC and 58\% plan to do so in the next project as well\cite{gdc-2022}.
In 2019, a survey of video game developers also existed with nearly 4000 participants\cite{gdc-2019}.
This survey showed that (besides publisher owned and own websites) most games are sold on Steam and itch.io.\\
