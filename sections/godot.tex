\section{Godot Engine}
The Godot Engine was released as open source under the MIT license on GitHub on February 10 in 2014\footnote{The first commit containing the source code can be found under the SHA:\\ 0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac}\cite{godot-repository}.
This makes it relatively new in comparison to popular game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, which were released in 2005 and 1998, respectively \cite{unity-release, unreal-release}.
The first stable release was published in December 2014 \cite{godot-release}.
Considering the different release dates, it should be clear that the Godot Engine has had less time to build a large ecosystem compared to the other two game engines mentioned.\\

The Godot Engine is cross-platform and supports the development of 2D or 3D games \cite{godot-engine}.
Video games can be exported for PC, mobile devices or web platforms.
These are written with a programming language specially developed for the Godot Engine called GDScript.
GDScript is a dynamically typed programming language which is syntactically similar to Python.
However, the Godot Engine also officially supports C\texttt{\#} and includes GDNative, a technology for creating bindings to other languages \cite{godot-gdnative}.
These officially include C\texttt{++} and C.
Unofficially support for languages such as D, Kotlin, Nim, Python and Rust have been developed by the community.\\

It's noteworthy that the Godot Engine appears to attract not only smaller companies but also larger players like Microsoft, Epic Games and Meta's Reality Labs.
Microsoft donated \$24,000 to the Godot team in 2017 for implementing C\texttt{\#} as a programming language \cite{godot-csharp}.
In 2020, the Godot Engine received the Epic MegaGrant of \$250,000, which is distributed by Epic Games to projects that expand the open source 3D graphics ecosystem \cite{godot-megagrant}.
This case in particular is interesting, because Epic Games is also the company responsible for the development of the Unreal Engine.
One possible reason for funding other game engines could be that the Unreal Engine might benefit from new technologies.
Especially an MIT license like Godot Engine has could allow for the adoption of intellectual property. 
However, this doesn't necessarily have to be negative, since both sides and the industry as a whole could benefit from it.
In December 2020 and 2021 Godot Engine received donations from Meta's Reality Labs \cite{godot-facebook-reality, godot-meta-reality}.
The funds will be used specifically for development in the field of extended reality (XR).
There is no public information available regarding the exact amount of the donation.
This was confirmed in a Reddit comment by project manager Rémi Verschelde (akien-mga) \cite{reddit-companies-akien}.
Rémi also mentioned that the team actively approaches companies rather than the other way around.
